# SUBMISSION TEMPLATE — internal per-paste record (validated file)

The validator (`tools/validate_sxs_turn.py`) runs on a file in exactly this shape.
Sections in this order. PICK/REASON/NEXT MESSAGE hold ONLY paste-ready text — no
commentary inside them.

```markdown
## MODE
START | COMPARE | SINGLE | END

## TURN
N of up to 10                 <!-- the turn number the NEXT MESSAGE will be; for END: "END at N" -->

## PICK
A | B | N/A         <!-- N/A only for START and SINGLE -->

## REASON
<optional platform note, 1-2 casual sentences, or "N/A">

## NEXT MESSAGE
<the exact user message Suraj will type — or "END - send nothing further, submit">
